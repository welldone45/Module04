3) What is the difference between OOP and POP? 

Ans:- Oop:1) Oop differ in their approach to software design and implementation
          2) Oop is based on objects and classes 
          3) Oop aims to create reusable and modular code.
          4) It have access specifier like public,private
 
      pop:-1) Pop differ in their approach to software design and implementation
	       2) while POP is based on procedures or functions
           3) while POP focuses on breaking down problems into smaller tasks and writing functions to solve those tasks.
           4) There is no any access specifier.
